			<div id="abouttext">
				<p>My name is Derek Jow; I am 19 years old, and I am
				currently studying Computer Science and Bioinformatics
				at University of California, San Diego. I love coding
				because you can make technology come to life in innovative ways
				that improve our life. In Computer Science, the only limit is your
				creativity; you can make anything you want come to life!
				
				<br/> <br/>
				
				I am also interested in Bioinformatics because it is a field that
				utilizes my love for coding in the  field of biology. I have always
				had a passion in studying microbiology because the great complexity
				of all the interactions that occur inside and outside the cell fascinate
				me. However, it is really the study of DNA - genetics - that I really
				want to explore because it controls EVERYTHING!
				
				<br/> <br/>
				
				When I'm not coding or studying for classes, I love playing video 
				games, riding my bike, playing board games or card games, playing
				the piano, and hanging out with friends! My favorite food is steak,
				my favorite movie is Inception, favorite book is The Hunger Games,
				favorite TV show is The Walking Dead, and I love playing
				Civilization V.
