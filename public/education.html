			<p id="abouttext">
			At UCSD, I am studying Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics. I have taken extensive
			courses in Java, C, C++. I have experience with creating Data Structures and using BASH on linux 
			systems. My skillset also includes using Vim, Git, Makefiles, Shell scripts, and XML, with a basic 
			understanding of JUnit, Ant, and Bugzilla. Furthermore, I have experience with HTML, CSS, and 
			Javascript.
			
			<br> <br>
 
			While my primary focus is Computer Science, I have an extreme passion for  biology so I decided to 
			specialize in bioinformatics so I can do research in the medical field using my skillset as a 
			computer scientist.

			<p id="abouttext">
			At Junipero Serra High School, I primarily focused on my education by taking AP classes focusing on 
			computer science and mathematics. As well as studying, I also did rowing (crew) after school and 
			started a coding club my senior year with classmates in my AP Computer Science class. Our focus
			was game design, and we created a small open world game we nicknamed JavaJesus - a post apocalyptic 
			rpg that takes place in San Francisco and much of the bay area. It was a fun project that I hope to
			continue someday!
